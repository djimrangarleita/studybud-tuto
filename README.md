## Concept

This is a project idea from a django course taught by Dennis Ivy on Youtube and on Udemy. The idea is to build a website like discord (not really discord) to help people find learning partners. It fosters the sense of accountability and motivation. I am at the beginning and don't know how far I can go with the tuto/course. I'll update this file accordingly, or maybe not.
I'm done with the first 3 hours and I have a basic CRUD app.

### Day 1: What I learnt in 3 hours(basic)

- [x] URLS
- [x] Templates
- [x] Models
- [x] CRUD Room Model
